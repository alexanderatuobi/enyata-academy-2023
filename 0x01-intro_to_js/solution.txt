1.  let is used when you need to reassign a variable,
    and const when you want to declare constants or variables 
    that should not be reassigned.

    The main difference between the two is: let variables 
    can be reassigned, while const variables are read-only 
    and cannot be reassigned once they are defined.

2.  After we have defined a variable, we use it by 
    referencing its name in the subsequent code. 

3.  You can declare a string by enclosing a sequence of 
    characters within single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), 
    or backticks (` `). Depending on weahter the string should
    be changed or shoud remain constant, we can declare a string 
    using 'let' or 'const', or sometimes 'var'.

4.  Yes we can. You can create strings using either single quotes 
    (' ') or double quotes (" "). Both single and double quotes 
    can be used interchangeably to define string literals.

5.  "9" is of type string while 9 is of type number.

6.  Declaration: It refers to the act of introducing a new variable 
    and specifying its name.

    Redeclaration: Redeclaration occurs when you attempt to declare 
    a variable with a name that is already defined within the same 
    scope.

    Assignment: Assignment involves giving a value to a variable for 
    the first time. It initializes the variable with a specific value.

    Reassignment: Reassignment occurs when you assign a new value to 
    an existing variable.
